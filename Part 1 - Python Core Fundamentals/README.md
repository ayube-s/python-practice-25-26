Part 1: Python Core Fundamentals (Days 1-20)
Introduction
Welcome to the first phase of the 100-Day Python Professional Challenge! This initial 20-day sprint is designed to build a rock-solid foundation in the core concepts of Python. We will start from the very beginning, ensuring every fundamental building block is firmly in place before moving on to more complex topics.

Each day features a small, real-world project that reinforces the concepts learned, taking you from writing your first line of code to building organized, functional command-line applications.

What You Will Learn & Accomplish
Over the next 20 days, you will master the essentials of Python programming, including:

The Absolute Basics: Understanding and using variables, different data types (strings, integers, floats), and arithmetic operators.

User Interaction: Getting input from users and providing formatted output using input() and f-strings.

Control Flow: Directing the logic of your programs with if/elif/else statements and while loops.

Core Data Structures: Storing and managing collections of data with lists and dictionaries, and iterating over them with for loops.

Code Reusability: Writing clean, modular, and reusable code by defining your own functions with arguments and return values.

Python's Standard Library: Importing and using powerful built-in modules like random and math to extend your program's capabilities.

File I/O: Interacting with the file system to read data from and write data to .txt files.

Error Handling: Building robust applications that can handle unexpected issues gracefully using try...except blocks.

End Goal for Part 1
By the end of Day 20, you will have the confidence and skills to write simple but complete Python programs from scratch. You will have a strong command of the fundamental syntax and logic that underpin all Python development. This solid base is the critical prerequisite for tackling the intermediate topics in Part 2, such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), APIs, and web scraping.
